#  DEPI Final Exam â€“ Java  

This repository contains my **final exam solutions** for the DEPI Java track.  
It includes **20 small Java tasks** and a **University Management System mini-project** where I applied Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside

###  Part 1 â€“ Java Practice Tasks
I solved 20 different Java problems, including:  
-  Bank Account Manager  
-  Factorial Calculator  
-  Number Guessing Game  
-  ATM Simulation  
-  Shape Area Calculator  
-  Password Validator  
-  Student Result System  
-  Rock, Paper, Scissors Game  
-  Calculator with Switch  
- ...and more (20 tasks in total)  

Each task helped me practice **loops, conditions, methods, encapsulation, and error handling in (JAVA)**.

**The functions that call each task or class etc.. most of them are commented because i did all the tasks in single project of java,
you need to un comment and comment the function you want to use or test.**

###  Part 2 â€“ University Management System
A mini-project built with **OOP principles**:  
-  Manage **Students** (Undergraduate & Postgraduate)  
-  Handle **Course Enrollment** (max 3 per student)  
-  Input grades and calculate GPA  
-  Polymorphic `displayInfo()` for different student types  
-  Validations (age, grades, course limits, etc.)  

This part brought together encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction in one program.

### What I Learned

> Practiced all 4 pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction).

> Improved problem-solving by writing 20 different Java programs.

> Built a complete mini-project (University Management System) from scratch.

> Gained confidence in Java fundamentals and clean code structure.
